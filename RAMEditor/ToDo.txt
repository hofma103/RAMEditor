counter which shows the amount of method calls during program execution
possibly also with an additional information about how many steps were inside loops (would be hard to determine due to all the possible uses of jump)

auto formatting with spaces when using -> <- to hint at loops (probably use this as a way to measure loop executions)
somehow also log the user input in the console
